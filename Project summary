2-After trying many features the most 2 features affecting the model is the Line spacing in the sentenses and the percentage of
  Captililzation in the sentense.
3- The Models used are Naive Bayes ,Decision Tree,SVM and logistic regression.
4- The Best performing models, on Top was Decision Tree and the Worst performing was Naive Bayes.
